## Abstract
Open web and linked data go pair to pair, however, it does not mean that the publication of linked data cannot have precise structures.
This document specifies the _shape index_ specification, designed for query optimization of linked data in networks of structured information.
A shape index maps an RDF data shape to a set of linked data resources, to provide lightweight yet powerful structural and statistical information about the content of the data within a defined region of a linked data network.
