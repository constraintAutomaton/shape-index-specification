# Shape Index Specification

The shape index specification repository.
An online version is available at [this hypermedia link](https://constraintautomaton.github.io/shape-index-specification/).
The specification is written in "pure" HTML, Javascript, and CSS thus does not require building.
Issues about the website or proposition of improvement can be made via the [github issues](https://github.com/constraintAutomaton/shape-index-specification/issues).

# Abstract

The open web and linked data are often seen as complementary,
yet this doesn't imply that data publication should be disorganized.
While the web as a whole lacks a clear structure,
web segments can still be structured through hypermedia descriptions and precise specifications.
This document introduces the <em>Shape Index</em> specification,
designed to facilitate data quality control and optimize query execution in decentralized unindexed networks of
linked
data.
The shape index leverages RDF data shapes to provide explicit constraints on data publication and provide
lightweight yet
powerful structural and statistical information about the content of RDF datasets in decentralized networks.
